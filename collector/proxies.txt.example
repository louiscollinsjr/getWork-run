# Proxy configuration for LinkedIn and rate-limited sites
# Format: username:password@host:port or host:port
# One proxy per line

# Example proxies (replace with your actual proxies)
# user1:pass1@proxy1.example.com:8080
# user2:pass2@proxy2.example.com:8080
# 192.168.1.100:3128
# 10.0.0.50:8080

# Free proxy services (use with caution in production):
# Note: Free proxies are often unreliable and may not work consistently
# Consider using paid proxy services for production use

# Instructions:
# 1. Copy this file to proxies.txt
# 2. Add your actual proxy servers
# 3. Test each proxy before adding to production
# 4. For LinkedIn scraping, rotating proxies are highly recommended
